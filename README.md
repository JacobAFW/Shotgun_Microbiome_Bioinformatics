# Shotgun_Microbiome_Bioinformatics

This repo contains a workflow I used that based largely around the [MetaWRAP](https://github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP/blob/master/Usage_tutorial.md) wrapper, however it steps outside of this a couple of times to use updated software (MetaWRAP have now update these). Some chunks can be run directly in the terminal, but others will require submission to the HPC as they are resource intensive. HPC jobs will be denoted with **(qsub)**. I will eventually adapt this to be used on the JCU [HPC](https://github.com/JacobAFW/JCU_workflows), but right now it relies on installing software and databases onto the HPC node.
